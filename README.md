Original site made from a tutorial by Brad Traversy @ Traversy Media

I changed most of the appearance and name from the original site, and also added some of my own products.

This is an eCommerce site made with the MERN stack and deployed on Render. Functionalities include adding products to cart and buying it (via PayPal sandbox), leaving reviews, creating a secured account, and viewing your profile. There are some added admin functionalities that allow to add products to the site, view orders, and manage user accounts.
